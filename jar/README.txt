You should be able to just double-click on the file for your OS and it'll run.

It might ask you to extract if you're browsing inside the zip.
Just say yes 
and then double-click on the extracted version.

If it says something like no privileges, then you have to make the file executable.

To do this, open up a terminal and type "chmod +x [filename]".


Enjoy!
