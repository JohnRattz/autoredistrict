Attached find data, statistics, images, and a district map both at the voting tabulation district level and at the block level, that was generated by a fully automated method, and is far superior to the current florida congressional districts.

The maps were designed using a genetic algorithm.  The program is free and the code is open source.  It is licensed GNU GPLv3.  The website for the program is here: http://autoredistrict.org/  and the source code is available here: https://github.com/happyjack27/autoredistrict

I am submitting this to you in hopes that it might aid you in your lawsuit against the gerrymanding by the Florida GOP. 

And in part because I saw the maps here: http://www.floridaredistricting.org/

I am confident that the attached map far exceeds all other maps on compactness, proportional representation, and competitiveness.  It should be the official district map for Florida federal congressional districts.

Any questions, please let me know.

And good luck!
